# Train-Scheduler

This app utilizes Firebase as a real-time database in order to store and print the user input. 

When a user finishes the form "adds a train" they will submit and will immediately see the train information displayed in the table.

The input information will also pass through moment.js where it will output relative information pending the user's local time.
    -See "minutesAway" / "nextArrival" variables in the app.js file.
